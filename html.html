                        Materials 
                        <ul> 
                            <li> Greeks made use of locally sourced materials like limestone, tufa, and marble (e.g., Pentelic and Parian marble).</li>
                            <li> Romans advanced Greek techniques, introducing Roman concrete (opus caementicium), bricks, and decorative glazed surfaces.</li>
                            <li> Despite its durability concerns, wood was widely utilized for roofing and truss systems </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        Methods
                        <ul>
                            <li> Greeks made use of the post-and-lintel system, with Doric and Ionic orders defining their architecture.</li>
                            <li> They built without mortar, relying on precise stone-cutting techniques.</li>
                            <li> Romans improved on Greek methods with opus reticulatum (diamond-shaped stone patterns in concrete) and opus testaceum (brick-layered concrete walls).</li>
                            <li> Romans pioneered the use of arches for larger and more durable structures like the Pont du Gard aqueduct.</li>
                        </ul>

                        Challenges
                        <ul>
                            <li> Greek construction was labor-intensive, requiring skilled artisans and enslaved workers.</li>
                            <li> Transportation of heavy materials, such as marble, posed several logistical issues.</li>
                            <li> The quality of Roman concrete varied, affecting structural stability, and their bricks, though <br> durable, were 
                                <br>prone to cracking.</li>
                            <li> Furthermore, wood was extremely vulnerable to fire and decay, especially in urban areas.</li>
                        </ul>
